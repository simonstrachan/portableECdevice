# Portable Electrochemical Device

## Overview
This repository contains the code, schematics, and documentation for the Portable Electrochemical Device developed as part of my PhD research project. The device is designed for the electrochemical detection of sugarcane diseases, however due to the versatility of the LMP91000 included, the device can be used for any electrochemical technique if programmed correctly.

## Features
- **Portable Design:** Compact and easy to transport for fieldwork.
- **Microcontroller-Based:** Powered by Arduino Nano, enabling real-time data processing.
- **User Interface:** Simple interface with LEDs and rotary encoder for easy operation and data visualization.

## Contents
- **Code:** All firmware and software required to operate the device.
- **Schematics:** Detailed circuit diagrams and PCB design for the Arduino Hat required to interface the ÂµC and IC.
- **3D Models:** STL files and Fusion360 file for Lid and Base.
- **Documentation:** Can be found in the published article above.
